Introduction

In emergency situations, timely medical intervention is crucial to saving lives. However, during patient transportation, whether in ambulances or other vehicles, continuous health monitoring remains a significant challenge. Delays in detecting critical conditions can worsen health outcomes, and the lack of real-time communication between vehicles and hospitals further complicates emergency response efforts. Our project aims to develop an advanced patient monitoring system that ensures real-time tracking of vital signs during transportation, enhancing pre-hospital care and improving patient outcomes.
